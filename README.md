# Final-Project
Big Data Class Final Project

Files in this repo include my final paper, the R code I used along with a shorter write-up of the overall project and the raw data used 

The data used is publically available from the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and use in this project conforms with their stated use guidlines.

The package GGOceanMap used to map the data requires additional data to be downloaded from:  install.packages("ggOceanMapsData", repos = c("https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/drat", "https://cloud.r-project.org")). If running my code in R ensure it is turned on, i;e line in functional. However turn it off (put # in front of line) if running in R markdown or it will not knit into a document. 

For whatever reson my computer does not like the Adobe knot option, a problem with LaTex apparently. I was able to knot inot a MS Word documet then save it as a PDF. However knitting directly into PDF from another terminal may result in slight formatting changes. Additinally, I had to make several changes in the Word doc, notable the font size of figure captions that would not otherwise translate from r markdown to the knitted MS Word doc.
